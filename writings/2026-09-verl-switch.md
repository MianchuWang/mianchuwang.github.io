> [!info] **Version.** This article studies [verl v0.8.0](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/tree/v0.8.0), released on June 1, 2026.

We examine verl's system design through a single training step of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on math problems. The discussion has three parts:

1. **Training loop:** the order of tasks in one step, and the data passed between them.
2. **Workers:** how one call from the loop runs on many GPUs, in the generation and training engines.
3. **GPU placement:** how generation and training are placed on GPUs, on the same ones or on separate ones, and what each choice costs in memory, weight transfer, and communication.

## 1. Training loop

The training loop is `RayPPOTrainer.fit`, at line 1362 of [`verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/blob/v0.8.0/verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py#L1362).

**What it does.** A task is one unit of work in a training step, such as generating responses, computing advantages, or updating the actor. `fit` decides the order of the tasks and passes data between them. It does not run the model. Each heavy task is a remote call to GPU workers. Only the advantage computation, which is light, runs inside `fit`.

**When it is called.** Once per run. `python3 -m verl.trainer.main_ppo` reaches it in three steps:

1. `main` in [`verl/trainer/main_ppo.py`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/blob/v0.8.0/verl/trainer/main_ppo.py#L38) reads the configuration and calls `run_ppo`.
2. `run_ppo` starts Ray and creates `TaskRunner`, a Ray actor with one CPU and no GPU.
3. `TaskRunner.run` builds the trainer, creates the GPU workers with `init_workers()`, and calls `fit()`.

The process that runs `fit` is the driver. `fit` returns when training reaches the last step.

### 1.1 Before the loop

Lines 1369–1420 run once, before the first step, in six parts:

| Lines | Part |
|---|---|
| 1369‑1370 | If the dump executor (a background thread that saves samples) was shut down, restart it. |
| 1372‑1381 | Create the logger. |
| 1383‑1389 | Load the checkpoint, send the weights to the generation side, compute the starting epoch. |
| 1391‑1400 | Validate once. Return if `val_only` is set. |
| 1402‑1404 | If `rollout.skip` is on, reuse saved rollouts instead of generating. |
| 1406‑1420 | Create the progress bar, set the step counter to 1, initialize bookkeeping variables. |
